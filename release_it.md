## Chapter 1

### Living in Production

Software design as taught today is terribly incomplete. It only talks about what systems should do. It doesn't address the converse, what systems should not do.

You will need to accept the fact that despite your best laid plans, bad things will still happen.

### Aiming for the Right Target

It aims to survive the artificial realm of QA, not the real world of production.

### The scope of the challenge

The increasing scope of this challenge - to build software fast that's cheap to build, good for users, and cheap to operate - demands continually improving architecture and design techniques. 

### A million dollars here, a million dollars there

Avoiding a one-time developmental cost and instead incurring a recurring operational cost makes no sense.

Design and architectural decisions are also financial decisions.

### Use the force

The earliest decisions you make can be the hardest ones to reverse later.

Production is the only place to learn how the software will respond to real-world stimuli. 

### Pragmatic architecture

An architect doesn't bother to listen to the coders on the team doesn't bother listening to the users either.
